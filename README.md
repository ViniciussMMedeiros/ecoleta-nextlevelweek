# ecoleta-nextlevelweek

<strong> Technologies used: </strong>

Node, JavaScript
<br> HTML
<br> CSS
<br> Express, nunjucks, nodemon
<br> Sqlite3

<p>
This application was created during the next level week by rocketseat, not by me. It was an interesting project to learn concepts about web programming and modern technologies such as Node JS and CSS inovations (grid and flex for example), so in the future I can explore these technologies and produce my own applications.

This application is a marketplace of waste collection in Brazil. A place where companies can sign up to register collection points. 
Then, people can search for a place to throw out waste in their states and cities. Dispose of cooking oil and electronic waste, for example.
